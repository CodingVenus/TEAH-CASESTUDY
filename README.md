# **TEKSYSTEMS CASE STUDY - POKETEAM ACADEMY**

## OBJECTIVE

This web app was originally envisioned to be an interactive website where fans of the Pokemon franchise would have an additional outlet they can use to explore their love of these little creatures. 


### TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
**DESIGN**
- LUCID CHART

**CODE**
- INTELLIJ
- JAVA
- SPRING BOOT
- SPRING DATA
- SPRING SECURITY
- MAVEN
- THYMELEAF
- PokeApi

**DATABASE**
- POSTMAN
- MYSQL


## THE PLAN
Build out a Spring Boot backend that would work with Thymeleaf to help craft a functional Full Stack Application.

### TABLE DIAGRAM
This can be found in the folder.


## THE PROCESS
For this application, I created the models, repositories, services, and controllers  of each entity individually before going back in and creating their relationships. I utilize the PokeAPi to extract data and then formatted it into visual cards that respresented a select number of Pokemon. 

Following requirements I utilized Spring Security to manage my sessions and password encyrptment. 

## CHALLENGES
- I faced multiple issues with properly configuring my Spring Security. The recent updates made to Spring Security made it a painful process to get up and running. Assitionally, because I was under strict time constraints to get this project finished, this made me rush into reading articles and manipulating my code before fully understanding the effects of my decisions. When this proved a fruitless effort, I took a step back and began more thoroughly researching the topic. While this did take up a big chunk of time, it eventually resulted in me being able to fix my issues.



## FUTURE DELIVERABLES
- SIMPLE JAVASSCRIPT GAMES
- SCOREBOARD
- RANKING
- CHAT SYSTEM
- DEPLOYMENT
